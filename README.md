# Mistakes
'Mistakes' is a being developed project in which we try to identify type of mistakes that foreign students make in Russian speech (writing texts). We try to train ML models (as RuCola) with our dataset to identify different mistakes automatically. Also we used clusters as an instrument to evaluate the adequacy of making vectors from our russian sentences. 
Prospectively we are going to create a source wich is likely to use for foreign students learn Russian as foreign.
